# Personal introduction
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Matúš Šedivý
- 🎓 I studied Microelectronics at [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vut.cz/en/), where I learned to program a microcontrollers (AtMega and MSP430) in *C*. I also learned basics of FPGA programing in *VHDL*. Later I got interested in OOP, especialy with *C++* (microcontrollers again), *C#* (WPF apps) and *python*.
- 📜 Then I made a "deal with a devil" and got stuck with *LabVIEW* which demages my last five brain cells. 😅
- 🔬 I’m currently working on my PhD in a group of [Magneto-optical and THz Spectroscopy](https://spectroscopy.ceitec.cz/).
